    \begin{rSubsection}{Practical Machine Learning with Rust}{Dec 2019}{Book}
    \item Explore machine learning in Rust and learn about the intricacies of creating machine learning applications. This book begins by covering the important concepts of machine learning such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, and the basics of Rust. Further, you’ll dive into the more specific fields of machine learning, such as computer vision and natural language processing, and look at the Rust libraries that help create applications for those domains. We will also look at how to deploy these applications either on site or over the cloud.
